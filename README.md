# Mr_Chibi's Item Magnet
Introducing a new brand release "**Item Magnet**" for Survival / Multiplayer!

## What was reason behind developing the tool?
- Allowing items to teleport in players inventory at 10 block distance
- Quality Of Life Tool creation and something simplistic.
- Easy to install / uninstall!

### How does it work!?
- Use a crafting table
- 1 compass in the middle
- 4 redstone dust surrounding it to craft!
- Leave compass in your inventory and items will teleport to the player and place in your off hand or chest to prevent teleportation!
